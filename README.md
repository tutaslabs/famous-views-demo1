Demonstrates famo.us mixed mode using Gadi Cohens famous-views Meteor package.

The DOM element in this demo has an additional transparent mesh overlayed on it so as to enable spectral lighting to reflect off of the DOM.

Pretty neat.

All done with 14 lines of code! Try that with native WebGL!

Clone into a new folder and start meteor!

Enjoy.
